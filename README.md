# PhotoMap Processor v0.9.0

A modern, high-performance photo mapping application with SQLite database storage and on-demand marker generation. Built with Rust for speed and reliability.

## ✨ Latest Improvements (v0.9.0)

- **Redesigned UI Panel**: Completely rebuilt experimental panel with modern row-based layout
- **Draggable Panel**: Move the control panel anywhere on the screen - position is saved automatically
- **User Location**: New "Where I" button to quickly center the map on your current location with green marker
- **Visual Polish**: Added subtle gray backgrounds to panel rows for better readability
- **Boundary Protection**: Panel automatically stays within viewport and resets to default position if off-screen
- **Compact Design**: Optimized input widths and spacing for a cleaner interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 📈 Version History

### v0.9.0 - UI Redesign & Interaction
- **Redesigned Control Panel**: Complete rebuild of UI panel with modern row-based layout
- **Draggable Panel**: Drag the panel to reposition it - automatically saves position to config
- **User Location Marker**: Green marker shows your current location, "Where I" button centers map on you
- **Boundary Protection**: Panel automatically stays within viewport and resets if moved off-screen
- **Visual Improvements**: Added subtle gray backgrounds to panel rows for better visual separation
- **Compact Inputs**: Narrower year inputs (60px) optimized for 4-digit years
- **CSS Cleanup**: Removed duplicate definitions and unnecessary comments

### v0.8.2 - Visualization & Polish
- **Heatmap & Routes**: Added visual layers to see photo density and travel paths.
- **Performance**: Added JSON compression for efficient handling of large photo collections.
- **Browser Autostart**: Added toggle to control automatic browser launch.
- **UI Polish**: Improved typography (Sentence case) and added GitHub link.
- **Note**: Binary size increased to ~3.5MB due to new visualization features and compression support.
- **CI Fixes**: Fixed Windows and macOS build failures.

### v0.8.1 - Performance & Size Optimizations
- **JPEG Encoding**: Unified all image types to use `turbojpeg` for 20-30% faster popup generation
- **Process Management**: Replaced `sysinfo` library with native OS commands (pgrep/tasklist)
- **MIME Detection**: Replaced `mime_guess` with simple pattern matching function
- **Binary Size**: Reduced from 2.55MB to 2.3MB (-10%)
- **UI**: Modern redesign with system fonts and compact spacing

### v0.8.0 - Instant Startup & Persistence
- **Binary Cache**: Implemented `bincode` persistence (`photos.bin`). The application now saves the database state to disk and reloads it instantly on startup if the source folder is unchanged.
- **UI Fixes**: Fixed "Open" button resizing glitch by enforcing minimum width.
- **Optimization**: Zero-latency startup for large collections (20k+ photos).

### v0.7.4 - Cluster Gallery & UI Polish
- **Cluster Gallery**: New modal interface for viewing large clusters (10+ photos), replacing the "spiderfy" effect.
- **Pagination**: Added pagination (28 items/page) to the gallery for better performance with hundreds of photos.
- **UI Updates**: "Source Folder" input is now editable and full-width. Added "Process" button for quick re-runs.
- **Thumbnails**: Standardized on 240x240px square thumbnails with white padding for non-square images.

### v0.7.3 - In-Memory Database & Logging
- **In-Memory Database**: Complete migration from SQLite (`rusqlite`) to `Arc<RwLock<Vec<PhotoMetadata>>>`. Solved Windows file locking issues (`SQLITE_BUSY`).
- **Logging**: Standardized log format (`DD HH:MM:SS`) and removed noise from dependencies (`ignore` crate).
- **Cleanup**: Removed migration code and file-based DB logic.

### v0.7.2 - Performance & Parser Edition
- **Database Optimization**: Batch inserts + WAL mode for significantly faster photo processing.
- **Custom GPS Parser**: Low-level parser for malformed EXIF (24% faster, handles Lightroom files).
- **Smart EXIF Fallback**: Multi-tier parsing strategy with `continue_on_error` and custom byte reader.
- **Enhanced Test Tool**: Auto-copy failed files, performance benchmarking.

### v0.7.1 - Windows & Exif Stability
- **Windows Fixes**: Fixed folder dialog focus and Russian path encoding issues.
- **Exif Improvements**: Added fallback logic for misnamed HEIC files (Xiaomi bug).

### v0.6.6 - UI & UX Enhancement Edition
- **Year Range Filter**: Filter photos by year range with dynamic min/max labels.
